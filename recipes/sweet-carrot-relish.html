            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>3 cups white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon celery salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mustard seed</li>
            <li>6 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground mustard</li>

            <li>3 (1 quart) sterilized canning jars with lids and rings</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cabbage, cucumber, tomato, carrot, onion, and pickling salt in a large bowl; toss to combine. Allow to sit 2 hours. Rinse the mixture thoroughly with cold water; drain and squeeze to remove excess liquid.</li>
            <li>Combine the vegetables with the water and vinegar in a large pot. Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to boil for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Stir the celery salt, mustard seed, and sugar into the vegetables. Mix the mustard, turmeric, and flour together in a bowl. Carefully spoon 2 tablespoons of the boiling water into the mustard mixture; stir into a paste. Add the paste back into the boiling vegetable mixture; cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes more. Cool completely in refrigerator before using.</li>
        </ol>
